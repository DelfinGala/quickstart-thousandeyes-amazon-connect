//TODO Vinod, Please redo this bullet list per our usual format. (You know the drill: Bullets need to mention every element in the diagram. Use the same terms verbatim in the bullets and in the diagram. Order the bullets as if giving a guided tour, starting wherever is most logical and following the arrows. See "Prepare your architecture diagram": https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/AWS_Quick_Starts/Process_for_PSAs/#HPrepareyourarchitecturediagram)

//TODO Vinod, Please clarify what we mean by "widget." That word can be used in lots of ways, and it's not self-evident from the image. For example, is the widget the whole screenshot or just the bottom part of it? Is this a screenshot of a cell phone? This diagram will appear on our landing page, too; first-timers may need clues to understand what they're looking at.
