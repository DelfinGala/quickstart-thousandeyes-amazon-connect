As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/[Amazon API Gateway^], which sets up the ThousandEyes Metrics Service.
* AWS Lambda functions, which query the customer's deployed ThousandEyes Endpoint Agents application to display relevant end-user metrics in the client widget. This Quick Start creates the following Lambda functions:
** *http*: Displays the http server response time to the Amazon Connect instance.
** *connection*: Displays the strength of the Wi-Fi signal.
** *network*: Displays the network-latency metrics.
** *agentInfo*: Name of the ThousandEyes agent that you associate with the client widget. The client-side code saves this metric in a browser cookie so that upon a browser refresh, this field is already set and does not need to be reentered.
** *status*: Verifies that the ThousandEyes API is running.
* The ThousandEyes Amazon Connect Health widget, which can be integrated with the [Amazon Contact Control Panel (CCP) softphone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/agent-user-guide.html). You can edit the client-side code to show additional metrics in the widget.
* An IAM role that is used for execution of the Lambda functions described above.
* Amazon Connect Contact Control Panel (CCP) softphone client, which interacts with Amazon Connect using Amazon Connect Streams API.

//TODO Marcia, "widget" is the bottom part of the Amazon CCP softphone client app that has been augmented to additionally display ThousandEyes metrics
